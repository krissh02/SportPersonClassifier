<h2>Introduction</h2>
The sports person classifier ML algorithm project is a cutting-edge application that leverages the power of machine learning to automatically classify sports persons from input images. This project involves the utilization of various libraries and technologies, including OpenCV, wavelet, and numpy, to preprocess and extract relevant features from the images. The core of the project lies in training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which learns from the extracted features to accurately predict the category of sports persons.</br>
To provide a user-friendly interface and enable seamless interaction, the project incorporates a Flask server that hosts a dedicated webpage. This webpage, built using HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery, allows users to upload images and receive real-time classification results. The integration of computer vision techniques, machine learning algorithms, and web development ensures an efficient and intuitive solution for sports person recognition.</br>
Through this project, users can gain insights into the category of sports persons depicted in the images they upload, enabling various applications such as athlete identification, sports analytics, and content organization. With its amalgamation of advanced technologies, the sports person classifier ML algorithm project represents a significant advancement in automating the classification of sports persons from images.</br>

<h2>Problem Scope</h2>
The problem scope of a sports person classifier involves accurately identifying and categorizing sports persons from input images. This includes challenges such as handling variations in pose, lighting conditions, backgrounds, and different sports. Additionally, the classifier may need to differentiate between similar sports or identify specific attributes within a sport. Achieving high accuracy and robustness across a wide range of sports and image conditions is crucial to ensure the classifier's effectiveness. Balancing computational efficiency and accuracy is another aspect within the problem scope, as real-time or near real-time classification may be desired in practical applications.</br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In conclusion, the sports person classifier project utilizes machine learning techniques, such as SVM, along with libraries like OpenCV, wavelet, and numpy, to accurately classify sports persons from input images. The project integrates a Flask server to host a user-friendly webpage, enabling users to upload images and receive real-time classification results. By combining computer vision, machine learning, and web development, this project provides an efficient and interactive solution for sports person recognition.
